## ‚ö†Ô∏è UNDER DEVELOPMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project is currently under active development. Features and functionalities may change.

**Access the online version here: [www.cashflower.online](www.cashflower.online)**

This application uses **Streamlit** for the frontend. The backend is built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **SQLite**. SQLite was chosen for its quick setup, minimal resource usage, and ease of local deployment, as each user is provisioned with a separate database. To further enhance calculation performance and simplify the codebase, the project utilizes two custom-built SQLite extensions for calculating the key financial metrics: [XIRR](https://github.com/mrkyc/sqlite-xirr-extension) (Extended Internal Rate of Return) and [STDDEV](https://github.com/mrkyc/sqlite-stddev-extension) (Standard Deviation). This approach allows complex calculations to be performed directly within the database using SQL, eliminating the need to transfer datasets out of the database for processing. The extensions themselves implement more functionality than is currently required by the application, but they were included to provide a robust foundation for future enhancements.

While the database schema was designed to allow for a single, shared database, the current implementation utilizes separate SQLite databases per user. This per-user database approach offers better isolation and scalability compared to a single shared database, potentially deferring the need for a more robust solution like PostgreSQL and making deployment on a VPS easier and more cost-effective.

The deployed online version runs on **Docker**, uses **Nginx** as a reverse proxy, and features fully encrypted connections via **Cloudflare**.

# üí∏üåª CashFlower - Investment Portfolio Analysis Platform

## üöÄ Introduction

CashFlower is a powerful and interactive Streamlit-based application designed to provide comprehensive financial portfolio analysis and visualization.

## üìà Key Performance Metrics

CashFlower provides a comprehensive set of metrics to analyze your investment portfolio's performance, risk, and cash flows. Below are the definitions and interpretations of the key metrics used across the dashboards:

*   **Market Value:** The current total value of all assets in the portfolio, calculated based on their latest available prices.
*   **Profit:** The absolute gain or loss on your investments, calculated as the difference between the current market value (plus any withdrawals/disposals) and the total invested amount (plus any deposits).
*   **Profit Percentage:** The percentage return on your investments, indicating the profitability relative to the invested capital.
*   **XIRR Rate (Extended Internal Rate of Return):** A sophisticated metric that calculates the annualized effective compounded return for a series of cash flows occurring at irregular intervals. It provides a more accurate measure of investment performance than simple return calculations, especially for portfolios with ongoing contributions and withdrawals.
*   **TWRR Rate (Time-Weighted Rate of Return):** A measure of the compound rate of growth of an investment portfolio over a specified period. It eliminates the distorting effects on growth rates created by cash inflows and outflows, making it suitable for comparing the performance of investment managers.
    *   **Daily:** The daily time-weighted rate of return.
    *   **Annualized:** The annualized time-weighted rate of return, calculated by compounding the daily TWRR.
*   **Drawdown:** The peak-to-trough decline in the value of an investment portfolio during a specific period, calculated based on daily changes in portfolio value, similar to TWRR, and thus excluding the impact of cash flows. It measures the downside risk of an investment.
    *   **Drawdown Value:** The absolute monetary value of the drawdown, calculated based on the actual market value of the portfolio, adjusted for the value of assets already sold. This adjustment prevents the drawdown from artificially increasing due to asset sales, ensuring that only market fluctuations impact the metric. It's important to note that new purchases can also reduce or eliminate an existing drawdown, as they increase the portfolio's overall value, potentially pushing it above a previous peak.
    *   **Drawdown Profit:** The drawdown calculated specifically on the portfolio's profit, showing the peak-to-trough decline in accumulated profit.
*   **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure of risk-adjusted return. It describes how much excess return you receive for the volatility you endure. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a better risk-adjusted return.
    *   **Daily:** Calculated using daily returns and daily standard deviation.
    *   **Annualized:** Calculated by annualizing the daily Sharpe Ratio.
    *   *Note: For simplification, the risk-free rate used in Sharpe Ratio calculations is currently assumed to be 0%. This may be configurable in future updates.*
*   **Sortino Ratio:** Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but it only considers downside volatility (standard deviation of negative returns), making it a better measure for investors concerned specifically with downside risk. A higher Sortino ratio indicates a better return for each unit of downside risk.
    *   **Daily:** Calculated using daily returns and daily downside deviation.
    *   **Annualized:** Calculated by annualizing the daily Sortino Ratio.
    *   *Note: For simplification, the risk-free rate used in Sortino Ratio calculations is currently assumed to be 0%. This may be configurable in future updates.*
*   **Cash Balance:** The current amount of cash held within the portfolio.
*   **Invested Amount:** The total cumulative amount of capital invested into the portfolio through deposits and asset purchases.
*   **Asset Disposal Income:** Income generated from selling assets.
*   **Asset Holding Income:** Income earned from owning or holding financial assets, including dividends, bond coupons, and other distributions.
*   **Interest Income:** Income earned from interest on cash or deposit holdings.
*   **Investment Income:** The total income generated from investments, including asset disposals, asset holdings, and interest.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction File Structure ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before uploading your transaction files, it's crucial to prepare your data according to the required structure. To ensure your transaction data is correctly processed, your transaction files (XLSX or CSV) must adhere to a specific structure. The following columns are required:

*   **date:** Date of the transaction (YYYY-MM-DD format).
*   **asset_symbol:** Symbol of the asset (e.g., "AAPL", "SPY", "SAP.DE", "MC.PA"). This must be a symbol recognized by Yahoo Finance. Always verify the exact quote symbol for your asset on Yahoo Finance to ensure correct data retrieval.
*   **transaction_type:** Type of transaction. Supported types are: "buy", "sell", "deposit", "withdrawal", "distribution", "interest", "fee".
    Here is a detailed description of each transaction type and when to use it:
    *   **buy**: Use when purchasing an asset (e.g., stocks, bonds, crypto).
    *   **sell**: Use when selling an asset.
    *   **deposit**: Use when adding cash to your investment account from an external source (e.g., a bank transfer).
    *   **withdrawal**: Use when removing cash from your investment account to an external destination.
    *   **distribution**: Use for receiving payments generated by assets you hold, such as dividends from stocks, bond coupons, or fund distributions.
    *   **interest**: Use for interest earned on cash held within your investment account.
    *   **fee**: Use for any standalone fees charged to your account that are not directly associated with another transaction (e.g., account maintenance fees, advisory fees).
*   **quantity:** Quantity of the asset involved in the transaction.
*   **transaction_value:** Value of the transaction in the analysis currency.
*   **fee_amount:** Any fees associated with the transaction in the analysis currency.
*   **tax_amount:** Any taxes associated with the transaction in the analysis currency.

The interpretation of the `quantity`, `transaction_value`, `fee_amount`, and `tax_amount` fields depends on the `transaction_type`. The system automatically handles the sign of the values (positive or negative), so you can provide either absolute values or values with signs in your file. Below is a detailed breakdown of how each field is interpreted for different transaction types:
*   **quantity:**
    *   `buy`: The quantity will be treated as positive.
    *   `sell`: The quantity will be treated as negative.
*   **transaction_value:**
    *   `deposit`, `sell`, `distribution`, `interest`: The value will be treated as positive.
    *   `withdrawal`, `buy`: The value will be treated as negative.
*   **fee_amount:**
    *   `deposit`, `withdrawal`, `sell`, `distribution`, `interest`, `buy`, `fee`: The amount will be treated as negative.
*   **tax_amount:**
    *   `sell`, `distribution`, `interest`: The amount will be treated as negative.

Instead, it saves a checkpoint and refreshes the data from that point, making subsequent calculations much faster than the initial one. This option allows you to force the application to recalculate all performance data from the beginning, clearing only the loaded data while keeping your settings intact. For example, if you add new or modified transactions with dates prior to the last calculation, you should use this option to ensure accurate recalculation of historical performance.

It is primarily used in case of unexpected errors, such as incorrect data loading or retrieval. Use with extreme caution.
